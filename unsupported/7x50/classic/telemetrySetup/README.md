# Nokia NSP Workflow Manager Blueprints
## 7x50 Setup Telemetry

### Description
This workflow will generate all the certificates required to enable the
telemetry API (using gRPC over TLS) on a Nokia SR OS device. The certificates
will be copied to the node along with the necessary configuration to enable
gNMI. If the node has physical port 1/1/1 configured, the workflow will enable
a 2 minute collection of telemetry data. The workflow initiates CLI sessions to both the 
REST gateway and the SR.

### Version
